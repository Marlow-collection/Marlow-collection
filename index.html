            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The following website and app will provide a seamless trade-in experience for sneaker enthusiasts looking to upgrade their footwear effortlessly. Customers can upload photos of their used shoes, receive a trade-in value within 24 hours, and use store credit to purchase a new pair.</p>
            <p>Every traded-in shoe undergoes a thorough inspection, cleaning, and, if necessary, professional refurbishment before being resold-ensuring high quality and value for every customer. This platform is designed to make sneaker upgrades affordable, convenient, and hassle-free.</p>
            <p>This website and app also make it easy and secure for customers to sell their sneakers. Sellers can list their shoes themselves or let our team handle the sale for them. To keep things safe, all users must sign up and verify their email and phone number before buying or selling. Plus, every listed shoe gets free social media promotion for better visibility.</p>
            <p>If you prefer to sell on your own, you can set your price and handle transactions directly. But if you want a hassle-free experience, our team can take care of everything-including meeting the buyer and handling delivery-for a small fee.</p>

            <h2>Trade In</h2>
            <p>A customer can upload photos of a used shoe they wish to trade in and submit it for verification on the platform. The verification process takes approximately 24 hours, during which the condition and market value of the shoe are assessed. Once the review is complete, the customer receives a trade-in value for their shoe. If they choose to proceed, they can top up the remaining amount and select a new pair from the available collection. This process ensures a smooth and hassle-free trade-in experience, allowing customers to upgrade their footwear conveniently.</p>
            <p>Once the company receives the shoes, they undergo a thorough cleaning process. If the shoes are in good condition and suitable for resale, they are listed back on the website. However, if they require repairs, they are sent to a professional shoe repair service where they are restored to like-new condition. Once fully refurbished, they are posted back on the website and sold at the price of a new pair. This ensures that every traded-in shoe meets the highest quality standards before being resold.</p>
            <h3>Example;</h3>
            <p>A customer looking to upgrade their sneakers decides to trade in their Jordan 4s, which they have used for two years, for a fresh pair of Air Force 1s priced at KSh 2,800. They upload six photos of their Jordan's on Marlow Collection, set their asking price, and wait for a response within 24 hours.</p>
            <p>After reviewing the condition of the sneakers, Marlow Collection offers a trade-in value of KSh 1,200. At this point, the customer can either accept the offer or reach out to customer support if they have any concerns.</p>
            <p>If they choose to proceed, they simply add the Air Force 1s to their cart, and the Jordan 4s are converted into a store voucher. They then top up the remaining amount, complete the purchase, and have their new sneakers delivered-making the trade-in process smooth and hassle-free.</p>

            <h2>Self Service</h2>
            <p>When a customer doesn’t want to trade in their shoes, they have the option to list them for sale on the website. They can upload pictures, set their own price, and sell the shoes themselves. However, there is a small fee to keep the listing on the website, but it is reasonably priced. If the shoe doesn’t sell, the customer still has the option to trade it in.</p>
            <p>This section of the website will be fully self-service. To ensure security, both buyers and sellers must sign up or log in using their email and phone number before making a purchase or listing a product. Sellers will also need to verify their email and phone number before listing items, and buyers must verify theirs before placing an order.</p>
            <p>To prevent fraud and item loss, we offer a secure selling option where Marlow Collection handles the entire sale. This includes meeting with the buyer, finalizing the sale, and delivering the shoes—all for an affordable service fee.</p>
            <p>Sellers also have the choice to handle sales themselves by including their preferred payment method in the shoe description. However, if a seller chooses to manage the sale independently and fraud occurs, Marlow Collection will not be held responsible for any losses.</p>
